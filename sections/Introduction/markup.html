	<h2 class=".h2">Introduction</h2>

	<p class=".text-justify"><strong>Smart table</strong> is an <a href="#">Angularjs</a> module to easily display data in
		a table with a set of built in features such filtering, sorting, etc. in a <strong>declarative way</strong>.
		While developing this module I made sure to focus on these particular points:</p>
	<div style="margin:1em 0;" class="bg-success padding">
	<ul>
		<li><strong>lightweight</strong>: smart-table is less than 4kb minified and has <strong>no
			dependencies</strong> other than Angular itself. And you can even reduce its size with a <a href="#">custom
			build</a> if you are not interested in some of the plugins.
		</li>
		<li><strong>robust</strong>: smart-table is widely tested which makes the module really stable</li>
		<li><strong>modular</strong> and <strong>extensible</strong>: The core features can be accessed with the controller
			API which is created by the top level directive. Then
			a set of directives (plugins) allow you to compose your table behavior in a declarative way.
		</li>
		<li><strong>developer friendly</strong>: the design of the module has been thought carefully and it is really
			easy to get into the source code to modify/customise the module to best fit your needs.
	</ul>

	<p>Although smart-table is by far the best table module for angular :D, there are other table modules in the
		angular ecosystem you might be interested in. The approach and philosophy are different and maybe more appropriate
		to your way of building web application. Among the most popular:</p>
	<ul>
		<li><a href="http://ui-grid.info/">UI Grid</a></li>
		<li><a href="http://esvit.github.io/ng-table/#!/">ng-table</a></li>
	</ul>
